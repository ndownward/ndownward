##Recent events
In October 2022, I had the privelege of attending the ACM Canadian Celebration of Women in Computing (CAN-CWiC) Conference in Toronto, Ontario alongside 650+ other female computer scientists. The weekend was jam-packed with keynote speakers, hands-on activities, and a career fair. <br>
It was amazing to engage with all of the other young and ambitious women who attended the conference, all under the common belief that women in computing deserve to be celebrated.

##Current Projects
My current projects have me diving into the world of game dev - an area of computer science that I hope to explore in a professional environment very soon.<br>
Take a peek at what I've done so far!

##Other Passions
When I'm not on my computer coding away for school, work, or personal projects, you can often find me at the gym! Software development tends to be quite a sedentary career, so I enjoy balancing my days with lifting weights, going for walks, or dragging one of my friends to a fitness class! In my spare time, also love to read, write, and explore local cafes with friends.
